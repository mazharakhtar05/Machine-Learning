# Student Performance Prediction using Linear and Logistic Regression
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# This program predicts:
# 1. Expected marks (using Linear Regression)
# 2. Whether the student will PASS or FAIL (using Logistic Regression)
# Based on study hours

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression

# Sample dataset
# Study hours vs Marks
x = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
y_marks = [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]  # For Linear Regression (continuous output)
y_passfail = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]    # For Logistic Regression (binary output: 0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

# Train Linear Regression model
linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(x, y_marks)

# Train Logistic Regression model
logistic_model = LogisticRegression()
logistic_model.fit(x, y_passfail)

# Take user input
hours = float(input("Enter how many hours you studied = "))

# Predict marks
predicted_marks = linear_model.predict([[hours]])[0]

# Predict pass/fail
result = logistic_model.predict([[hours]])[0]

# Show results
print(f"\n📘 Study Hours: {hours}")
print(f"📊 Predicted Marks: {predicted_marks:.2f}")
if result == 1:
    print("✅ You are likely to PASS")
else:
    print("❌ You are likely to FAIL")
